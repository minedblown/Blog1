          <h2 class="section-heading">Might trick me once, but wont let you...</h2>

          <p>Along with the majority of ‘ordinary’ people, the existence of Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies went unoticed until a slow Boxing Day
            morning, in 2017, where my tech savvy younger cousin clued me up about the recent surge of this digital currency Bitcoin and its closely following compatriot,
            named Ethereum. I feigned some interest and he described how he came into a few Ethereum playing an online game. The concept went largely over my head and it failed to grip me,
            until I realised these same coins had rallied well over 1000% since their introduction. I swiftly decided that I would download Coinbase and jump on the bandwagon with the last £100
            of my student overdraft. Confident of a 10x return, I could pay that back later.

</p>

          <p>As it turned out, I had unwittingly FOMO’d (acted in the fear of missing out) into a craze at the peak of a price surge and I watched my small but exciting investment diminish over a few weeks, before I lost interest its existence. When I heard no more about this over hyped winter phenomenon I assumed that the blockchain fad was dead and I continued about my business spending my FIAT currency to the brink of my available credit.</p>

          <p>My next encounter, just a few months ago, has been a vastly different experience. In the midst of a global pandemic, travel plans were off the table. As a teacher in the Middle East and with a hot summer ahead of me, I had some spare time on my hands. After an expensive exposure to commodities trading, I was re-awoken to cryptocurrencies as I read an article entitled ‘Bitcoin or Gold?’ , a piece discussing which asset would be the best investment of 2020/21.</p>

          <p>I quickly recovered my Coinbase account and saw a vastly different offering to that which I’d seen before. My rediscovery neatly coincided with the latest blockchain buzz word ‘DeFi’
          and I decided to add to my funds for a second time with a few hundred dollars during a frenzy at its peak.
          This time, however, I can say with some confidence that those few hundred dollars were well spent.
          In spite of my fairly dismal initial investment, my interest was peaked and as I began to discover a multitude of decentralised apps (DApps) that existence in an eco system full of opportunities.
          I realised that this was a field of true ingenuity that was anything but a passing fad.</p>

          <p>Today, in the settling wake of the US election result, Bitcoin is surging towards new all time highs and the attention of retail investors will surely be captured in these coming months.
            This blog will be pitched to those who may not have much prior exposure to the world of decentralised finance. So far in my few short journey in DeFi, I've staked tokens for interest on COMP, I've provided liquidity on UniSwap, I've taken a crypto loan with AAVE, I've done yield farming with YFI and YFDai, I've bought first generation NFTs from Bondly,
            I've joined the fight club of Duck Dao and got early entrance to BASE protocol and even more. This is an ecosystem of interesting products and real functionality.
            <b>

          I truly believe that your mind will be blown. </b> Follow this blog as I will set out to caution against some common ‘newbie’ trip wires that I’ve stumbled upon myself as well as to draw your attention to some exciting new opportunities. </p>

          <p>
          The potential of ‘DeFi’ has been compared to the dot com boom and I now share this opinion as a true enthusiast. Patience is certainly necessary, as with every new venture, but I hope you will enjoy your journey wherever it take you. As my portfolio is growing, my future aim is to launch a Dapp offering a solution to renewable energy adoption.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">How to start?</h2>

          <p>
          The first thing I will make clear here is that <b> ANYONE </b> can enter the decentralised finance space. You don't need vast sums of money or a degree in computer Science.
          All that's required is a bit of time to you learn the basics and a cautious approach. The later will serve you well, as there are certainly plenty of ways to loose your money. Risks aside there is all sorts of fun to be had.
          Step one is to get some access to some cryptocurrency funds, for this you have several options. I am going to present three of these options. <p/>

          <!-- <blockquote class="blockquote"> Just roll up your sleaves and dive straigt in </blockquote> -->

                    <blockquote class="blockquote"> "Getting into DeFi is much like learning to swim, you need to jump into the pool and get hands on but it's useful to dip your toe in, strap on
            some arm bands and figure out which ends the deep end first. That said, I did none of the above and I am still here." </blockquote>

          <p>

                        <u>Option 1 - Centralised exchanges</u>
            <br/>
            </br/>

          There are several centralised exchanges out there - which will allow you to buy crypto/ deposit funds via your credit card.
          A popular example is Coinbase. This is an easy option, as it's easy to deposit and the user interface is straight forward but I do not think it is the best option. Fees are
          generally high, the coin listings are limited and the exchange rates aren't transparent. A positive feature is that Coinbase has a useable wallet which can interact with some Dapps easily.

          <br/>

        </br/>

          Binance is an alternative centralised exhange which is more centred to those who which to trade cryptocurrency pairs. The advantages of Binance are the many different options for
          trading and a wide range of coin listings. Bincance also allows for leveraged trading although this carries high risk so I would proceed with extreme caution. A negative is that binance
          does not seem to have a functional wallet feature for interacting with Dapps easily.

          <br/>

        </br/>

          Both of these exchanges require KyC so you will have to prove your identity before you get started - the cryptocurrecy is also not truely yours as the exchange retains true ownership of
          any cryptocurrencies they hold. So whilst you will be able to trade crypto currency and you will be able to interact with Dapps, your funds will still be centralised with the exchange
          owners.

          <p/>

        <p>


          <u> Option 2 - Using a browser wallet </u>

          <br/>
</br/>          The browser wallet that I highly recommend would be Metamask, which is a google chrome extension and very straight forward to use once you have the hang of it. Metamask allows you to
          neatly interact with Dapps and allows you to swap you crypto on decentralised exchanges, such as UniSwap (more to come on this). The advantage of using Metamask is that you can hold any ERC20 token
          and you are in full control of your finances. The negative is that is takes a tiny bit of getting used to and a few small leaps of faith (until you get used to it).

          Find below a video on how to download metamask. Metamask will be used in future posts when reviewing Dapp experiences.

          </p>

          <p>
            <u> Option 3 - Use a hardware wallet </u>

            A hardware wallet, such as the ledger nano, is a physical hardward device which securely stores your funds. This is the most secure device and it is recommended that any significant capital is kept on one of these.
            Your hardware wallet can be plugged into your PC and it can interact with your Metamask wallet. The disadvantage is that you have to buy one and that you will have to store it safely and back it up. If you lose/ forget your pass phrase then
            your funds will also be lost.

          </p>

<p>
          In summary, Ledger nano is the most secure for serious investors, Coinbase is an easy entrance to crypto, Binance is your one stop trading shop and Metamask is your most functional way of interacting with Dapps. In reality I
          have used all of the wallets/ exchanges I've discussed for different reasons. Whichever you begin with, you are now all set.
</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">What even is DeFi?</h2>

                  <p>
          So it would make some sense to epxlain the Blockchain at this point but I'm no expert so I've found one and linked in their video. In summary, blockchain technology cuts out the middle man -
          Bitcoin and Ethereum are the main two independent blockchains, although many others exist. Bitcoin is primarily used as a ledger system that acts a balance sheet to keep tab of all transactions
          between different parties. The Ethereum Blockchain has more varied functionality as it can store 'smart contracts' which allow for far wider reaching purposes such as Dapp development. It is the
          Ethereum Blockchain on which a large proportion of DeFi projects exist. A few key ideas include:

          <ul>
  <li> Smart contracts are a form of logic on which Dapps are built on.  </li>
  <li> Transactions are made between user accounts and/ or smart contracts, the data for which are all stored on the Blockchain </li>
  <li> All successful/ verified transactions are recorded in order and they are irreversible.  </li>
  <li> Each transaction has a 'Gas fee' which can be thought of as a fee to verify your transaction. </li>


</ul>

</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">I remember my first Dapp</h2>

<p>
  With one foot now in the door, why stop now? It is time to interact with a Dapp and see what the fuss is about. It is my intention in this wider blog to walk you through how to use some of the apps I've stumbled across
  and to review my experiences of new offerings.
</p>
<p>
  I have decided to introduce you to YF-Dai as I think it's a project with a good future and the potential to earn good returns, as it has an interesting deflationary model for 'tokenomics' meaning that there is a dimishing supply of coins and that
  new coins cannot be minted. YF-Dai offers many services across it's platform including staking and farming, both of which I will explain. To interact with this Dapp you will also have to use UniSwap, so lets kill two birds with one stone.
</p>
  <p>
  Staking is the process where you provide liquidity to the platform and in return you earn interest. YF-Dai is currently offering a rate of 72% APR! A rate I challenge you to find at the bank.

</p>
  <p>

  Farming is a different offering, as the kickback from farming is generated from fees on the swapping of YF-DAI tokens with other tokens. The farming vaults offer different rewards depedning on the length your funds are locked up for.

</p>

<p>
  BEWARE to take into account Gas prices and fees for when you deposit and withdraw your funds. Further, these interest rates are not always fixed so you are entering at your own risk. Below are some snapshots and a link to the YF-DAI tutorial.
</p>

  <p>

In my next post I'll be reviewing some lending and borrowing platforms and talking about how to gain early entry into new projects through the DuckDao incubator clubs.
